                    Carmignac Photojournalism Award 
                    has celebrated – and supported – 
                    emerging photojournalists around 
                    the world. The winners are invited to visit, 
                    and document, places that are at the centre 
                    of geostrategic conflict, where human 
                    rights and freedom of speech are often 
                    violated. These geographic zones have, 
                    to date, included Gaza, Pashtunistan, 
                    Zimbabwe, Chechnya, Iran and, in the 
                    latest award, the 'lawless areas' in France.
                    The Fondation Carmignac collaborates 
                    with the winners throughout the project, 
                    giving the laureate €50,000 to finance their 
                    work in the field. On their return, their 
                    images are published in book form and are 
                    given an international touring exhibition.
                    As well as this, each laureate has four 
                    photographs purchased by the foundation 
                    for its prestigious collection.
                    This exhibition at the Saachi Gallery is 
                    entitled Carmignac Photojournalism 
                    Award: A Retrospective and shows the 
                    award-winning work in time order, 
                    working backwards from the fifth 
                    Carmignac laureate, Newsha Tavakolian, 
                    an Iranian photojournalist, whose work 
                    explores the Iranian young middle-class 
                    caught between contemporary society 
                    and Islamic ideology.
                    In the second room we find the work 
                    of Davide Monteleone, the fourth 
                    Carmignac winner. An Italian, 
                    Monteleone’s imagery focuses on Chechnya.

                    Hammond whose imagery focuses on 
                    Zimbabwe, and Massimo Berruti whose 
                    report reveals the suffering caused by 
                    Taliban terrorists in Pakistan and the 
                    resistance by local people.
                    The exhibition continues with the award’s 
                    first laureate, Kai Wieden Hofer, with his 
                    series of images from Gaza.
                    At the very end of the exhibition is one 
                    single black & white image by Christophe 
                    Gin, who won the award this year. His work 
                    is on the 'lawless areas' of France and is 
                    currently displayed in an exhibition at the 
                    Chapelle des Beaux-Arts in Paris and will be 
                    shown in London next year. An exhibition worth visiting 
                    given the amazingly high reviews. With free entry and 
                    auditory guides it is an experience truly worth the time and a
                    cultural enrichment.
