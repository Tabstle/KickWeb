            <p><span class="firstLetter">M</span>y first in-depth encounter with 
                Alec Soth was through his latest 
                publication, Songbook, which I 
                reviewed when it came out last 
                spring. As I delved into the background of 
                the work, I became increasingly fascinated. 
                What had started as a playful venture with 
                a friend had become an important body of 
                work, but more than that, it was the way in 
                which it emerged that was intriguing.
                Songbook began when Soth and writer 
                Brad Zellar set out under the guise of 
                working on a local newspaper reporting
            </p>
            <p>
                on small town communities. As the work 
                progressed they went from a fictional 
                newspaper to a real life one, published 
                through Soth’s Little Brown Mushroom 
                publishing house. Finally, in yet another
            </p>
            <p>
                form, the work became a book.
                I met Alec Soth in late September as he 
                was hanging his exhibition, Gathered Leaves, 
                at Media Space in London. Bringing together 
                a decade of work through four series, 
                Sleeping by the Mississippi (2004), Niagara
                (2006), Broken Manual (2010) and Songbook
                (2015), the exhibition is an impressive 
                account of the progression of an artist.
                As we sat over coffee, while he took a break 
                from the practicalities of exhibition hanging, 
                we talked about his approach to photography 
                and I asked him if he could tell me more

            <h3 class="quote">‘That’s what I like about

                to tragedy or mayhem and

                between the two’</h3>

                humour in my pictures but they’ve often 
                been described as sad and I’ve felt a little 
                disappointed by that. But with Songbook
                I pushed that button much harder.’
                He goes on to talk about the nature of 
                humour itself and how and why we are 
                touched by it. ‘The best stand-up comics 
                make you feel uncomfortable but you 
                laugh at the same time. That’s what I like 
                about humour, that it’s very close to 
                tragedy or mayhem and I like walking 
                that line between the two.’
                Nothing could describe Soth’s 
                work better than that statement. The 
                photographs in Songbook reveal people lost 
                and estranged from mainstream society, 
                struggling to re-engage, often through
                moments of bizarre action or eccentricity.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The longing for connection is obvious, 
                precarious and momentary. I ask Soth if 
                he feels that society – particularly 
                American society – suffers from 
                disconnectedness in these modern times. 
                ‘I have to be careful about making big 
                declarations about society because I’m
                aware that I have my own way of seeing 
                the world and connecting with society,
            </p>
            <p> 
                and there’s part of me that projects my 
                own view on to other things,’ he explains. 
                ‘I think art is all about trying to connect. 
                The thing I’ll say about Songbook, and 
                the other work in the exhibition, is that 
                it’s all American work and I do think that 
                the US has its own relationship to social 
                disconnection – in part because of the way 
                it treasures individualism.’

                <span class="firstLetter">A</span>lec Soth is difficult to pin 
                down. Warm, humorous and 
                delightfully engaging as he is, 
                he slips through your fingers if 
                you try to define him. But maybe that’s a
