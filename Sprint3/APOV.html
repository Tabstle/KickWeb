                <p><span class="firstLetter">M</span>y first in-depth encounter with 
                    Alec Soth was through his latest 
                    publication, Songbook, which I 
                    reviewed when it came out last 
                    spring. As I delved into the background of 
                    the work, I became increasingly fascinated. 
                    What had started as a playful venture with 
                    a friend had become an important body of 
                    work, but more than that, it was the way in 
                    which it emerged that was intriguing.
                    Songbook began when Soth and writer 
                    Brad Zellar set out under the guise of 
                    working on a local newspaper reporting 
                    on small town communities. As the work 
                    progressed they went from a fictional 
                    newspaper to a real life one, published 
                    through Soth’s Little Brown Mushroom 
                    publishing house. Finally, in yet another
                    form, the work became a book.
                    I met Alec Soth in late September as he 
                    was hanging his exhibition, Gathered Leaves, 
                    at Media Space in London. Bringing together 
                    a decade of work through four series, 
                    Sleeping by the Mississippi (2004), Niagara
                    (2006), Broken Manual (2010) and Songbook
                    (2015), the exhibition is an impressive 
                    account of the progression of an artist.
                    As we sat over coffee, while he took a break 
                    from the practicalities of exhibition hanging, 
                    we talked about his approach to photography 
                    and I asked him if he could tell me more
                    about the sense of unreality – a sort of 
                    dream-like quality – that permeates much of 
                    his work. ‘I’m not a hardcore documentary 
                    photographer,’ he explains. ‘I come from the 
                    arts side of things – I start out with 
                    surrealism and then push it towards 
                    journalism.’ He goes on to describe his way 
                    of seeing the world that is ‘just a little askew’. 
                    It’s this ability to recreate his way of seeing 
                    – his vision – that is the key to Songbook. 
                    As we talk, I begin to see that Soth is 
                    a man who takes himself seriously but at 
                    the same time dismisses that seriousness. 
                    It’s a position that few can fully achieve, 
                    but it’s also a place from which creativity
                    is allowed to develop freely. ‘When Brad
                    and I started out it was just a case of “let’s 
                    goof around”,’ he explains. ‘I’m a great 
                    believer in play. Songbook was born out of 
                    playfulness, for sure. But, of course, it built 
                    up over time. It’s like, say, some musicians
                    starting out by playing in their basement 
                    and then going out to do shows and then 
                    bigger shows until it turns into something 
                    else. And then you have to deal with the 
                    consequences of that too.’

            <div class="middle text">
                <p><span class="firstLetter">A</span>lec Soth’s work has often been 
                    described as melancholic and 
                    nostalgic and while these 
                    descriptions are fitting, I found as 
                    I absorbed myself in Songbook, I discovered 
                    a deeply humorous side to the work. 
                    I ventured to tell him this, wondering what 
                    his reaction would be. Fortunately, he was 
                    delighted. ‘I think there has always been 
                    humour in my pictures but they’ve often 
                    been described as sad and I’ve felt a little 
                    disappointed by that. But with Songbook
                    I pushed that button much harder.’
                    He goes on to talk about the nature of 
                    humour itself and how and why we are 
                    touched by it. ‘The best stand-up comics 
                    make you feel uncomfortable but you 
                    laugh at the same time. That’s what I like 
                    about humour, that it’s very close to 
                    tragedy or mayhem and I like walking 
                    that line between the two.’
                    Nothing could describe Soth’s 
                    work better than that statement. The 
                    photographs in Songbook reveal people lost 
                    and estranged from mainstream society, 
                    struggling to re-engage, often through
                    moments of bizarre action or eccentricity.
                    The longing for connection is obvious, 
                    precarious and momentary. I ask Soth if 
                    he feels that society – particularly 
                    American society – suffers from 
                    disconnectedness in these modern times. 
                    ‘I have to be careful about making big 
                    declarations about society because I’m
                    aware that I have my own way of seeing 
                    the world and connecting with society,
                    and there’s part of me that projects my 
                    own view on to other things,’ he explains. 
                    ‘I think art is all about trying to connect. 
                    The thing I’ll say about Songbook, and 
                    the other work in the exhibition, is that 
                    it’s all American work and I do think that 
                    the US has its own relationship to social 
                    disconnection – in part because of the way 
                    it treasures individualism.’

                <p><span class="firstLetter">A</span>lec Soth is difficult to pin 
                    down. Warm, humorous and 
                    delightfully engaging as he is, 
                    he slips through your fingers if 
                    you try to define him. But maybe that’s a 
                    mark of a truly original photographer who 
                    has spent years developing the ability to 
                    speak in his own voice. ‘It’s a long process, 
                    working with the language of photography, 
                    meeting people and being influenced by 
                    them and slowly bringing out that shred of 
                    distinctive personality that you have,’ he 
                    says. ‘The incredible thing for me is how 
                    simple photography is and how hard it is. 
                    Taking a picture is not difficult. But taking 
                    50 good pictures that work well together is 
                    incredibly hard. Almost impossible.’
                    With that sense of the impossible always 
                    in sight and always challenging, Alec Soth’s 
                    work seems to change and grow relentlessly. 
                    ‘I don’t like to have a consistent tone in 
                    my pictures,’ he says. It remains to be seen 
                    where that inventiveness will take him next.
