            <p><span class="firstLetter">M</span>y first in-depth encounter with 
                Alec Soth was through his latest 
                publication, Songbook, which I 
                reviewed when it came out last 
                spring. As I delved into the background of 
                the work, I became increasingly fascinated. 
                What had started as a playful venture with 
                a friend had become an important body of 
                work, but more than that, it was the way in 
                which it emerged that was intriguing.
                Songbook began when Soth and writer 
                Brad Zellar set out under the guise of 
                working on a local newspaper reporting
            </p>
            <p>
                on small town communities. As the work 
                progressed they went from a fictional 
                newspaper to a real life one, published 
                through Soth’s Little Brown Mushroom 
                publishing house. Finally, in yet another
            </p>
            <p>
                form, the work became a book.
                I met Alec Soth in late September as he 
                was hanging his exhibition, Gathered Leaves, 
                at Media Space in London. Bringing together 
                a decade of work through four series, 
                Sleeping by the Mississippi (2004), Niagara
                (2006), Broken Manual (2010) and Songbook
                (2015), the exhibition is an impressive 
                account of the progression of an artist.
                As we sat over coffee, while he took a break 
                from the practicalities of exhibition hanging, 
                we talked about his approach to photography 
                and I asked him if he could tell me more
