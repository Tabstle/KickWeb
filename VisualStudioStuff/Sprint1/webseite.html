            <p><span class="firstLetter">M</span>y first in-depth encounter with 
                Alec Soth was through his latest 
                publication, Songbook, which I 
                reviewed when it came out last 
                spring. As I delved into the background of 
                the work, I became increasingly fascinated. 
                What had started as a playful venture with 
                a friend had become an important body of 
                work, but more than that, it was the way in 
                which it emerged that was intriguing.
                Songbook began when Soth and writer 
                Brad Zellar set out under the guise of 
                working on a local newspaper reporting
            </p>
            <p>
                on small town communities. As the work 
                progressed they went from a fictional 
                newspaper to a real life one, published 
                through Soth’s Little Brown Mushroom 
                publishing house. Finally, in yet another
            </p>
            <p>
                form, the work became a book.
                I met Alec Soth in late September as he 
                was hanging his exhibition, Gathered Leaves, 
                at Media Space in London. Bringing together 
                a decade of work through four series, 
                Sleeping by the Mississippi (2004), Niagara
                (2006), Broken Manual (2010) and Songbook
                (2015), the exhibition is an impressive 
                account of the progression of an artist.
                As we sat over coffee, while he took a break 
                from the practicalities of exhibition hanging, 
                we talked about his approach to photography 
                and I asked him if he could tell me more

                “let’s goof around”,’ he

                about the sense of unreality – a sort of 
                dream-like quality – that permeates much of 
                his work. ‘I’m not a hardcore documentary 
                photographer,’ he explains. ‘I come from the 
                arts side of things – I start out with 
                surrealism and then push it towards 
                journalism.’ He goes on to describe his way 
                of seeing the world that is ‘just a little askew’. 
                It’s this ability to recreate his way of seeing 
                – his vision – that is the key to Songbook. 
                As we talk, I begin to see that Soth is 
                a man who takes himself seriously but at 
                the same time dismisses that seriousness. 
                It’s a position that few can fully achieve, 
                but it’s also a place from which creativity
                is allowed to develop freely. ‘When Brad
            </p>
            <p> 
                and I started out it was just a case of “let’s 
                goof around”,’ he explains. ‘I’m a great 
                believer in play. Songbook was born out of 
                playfulness, for sure. But, of course, it built 
                up over time. It’s like, say, some musicians
                starting out by playing in their basement 
                and then going out to do shows and then 
            </p>
            <p> 
                bigger shows until it turns into something 
                else. And then you have to deal with the 
                consequences of that too.’

                <span class="firstLetter">A</span>lec Soth’s work has often been 
                described as melancholic and 
                nostalgic and while these 
                descriptions are fitting, I found as 
                I absorbed myself in Songbook, I discovered 
                a deeply humorous side to the work. 
                I ventured to tell him this, wondering what 
                his reaction would be. Fortunately, he was 
                delighted. ‘I think there has always been

                humour in my pictures but they’ve often 
                been described as sad and I’ve felt a little 
                disappointed by that. But with Songbook
                I pushed that button much harder.’
                He goes on to talk about the nature of 
                humour itself and how and why we are 
                touched by it. ‘The best stand-up comics 
                make you feel uncomfortable but you 
                laugh at the same time. That’s what I like 
                about humour, that it’s very close to 
                tragedy or mayhem and I like walking 
                that line between the two.’
                Nothing could describe Soth’s 
                work better than that statement. The 
                photographs in Songbook reveal people lost 
                and estranged from mainstream society, 
                struggling to re-engage, often through
                moments of bizarre action or eccentricity.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The longing for connection is obvious, 
                precarious and momentary. I ask Soth if 
                he feels that society – particularly 
                American society – suffers from 
                disconnectedness in these modern times. 
                ‘I have to be careful about making big 
                declarations about society because I’m
                aware that I have my own way of seeing 
                the world and connecting with society,
            </p>
            <p> 
                and there’s part of me that projects my 
                own view on to other things,’ he explains. 
                ‘I think art is all about trying to connect. 
                The thing I’ll say about Songbook, and 
                the other work in the exhibition, is that 
                it’s all American work and I do think that 
                the US has its own relationship to social 
                disconnection – in part because of the way 
                it treasures individualism.’

                <span class="firstLetter">A</span>lec Soth is difficult to pin 
                down. Warm, humorous and 
                delightfully engaging as he is, 
                he slips through your fingers if 
                you try to define him. But maybe that’s a

                mark of a truly original photographer who 
                has spent years developing the ability to 
                speak in his own voice. ‘It’s a long process, 
                working with the language of photography, 
                meeting people and being influenced by 
                them and slowly bringing out that shred of 
                distinctive personality that you have,’ he 
                says. ‘The incredible thing for me is how 
                simple photography is and how hard it is. 
                Taking a picture is not difficult. But taking 
                50 good pictures that work well together is 
                incredibly hard. Almost impossible.’
                With that sense of the impossible always 
                in sight and always challenging, Alec Soth’s 
                work seems to change and grow relentlessly. 
                ‘I don’t like to have a consistent tone in 
                my pictures,’ he says. It remains to be seen 
                where that inventiveness will take him next.
