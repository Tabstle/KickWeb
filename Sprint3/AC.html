                    portraits of musicians and 
                    celebrities, Cincinnati-based photographer Michael 
                    Wilson’s portraits stand out as 
                    uniquely authentic, warm and 
                    at times humorous. In viewing 
                    his images, we’re able to spend 
                    a bit of personal time laughing 
                    and getting to know these artists 
                    through Wilson’s eyes. And 
                    that’s a truly remarkable gift.
                    Interestingly, Wilson 
                    unexpectedly stumbled into 
                    photography in high school. 
                    After becoming intrigued with 
                    it, he purchased a Pentax 35mm 
                    SLR. He hadn’t planned to 
                    attend college and was surprised 
                    when he earned a scholarship to 
                    Northern Kentucky University. 
                    Not knowing what to select 
                    as a major, he learned they 
                    offered a degree in photography 
                    and without further thought 
                    selected it as his major. It was 
                    there that he immersed himself 
                    in photography and credits his 
                    first teacher, Barry Andersen, 
                    for opening his eyes to all the 
                    possibilities of the art form.
                    After college he began a 
                    succession of jobs, mostly 
                    unrelated to photography, but 
                    continued to make pictures. 
                    Following a four-year stint 
                    working as a photographer’s 
                    assistant and darkroom 
                    technician for a textbook 
                    publisher, he decided to become 
                    a freelance photographer after 
                    he realised he was growing 
                    frustrated and his enthusiasm 
                    for photography was slipping 
                    away. As his wife, Marilyn, 
                    believed wholeheartedly in his 
                    abilities, she subsidised their 
                    finances by working in a variety 
                    of jobs in those early years. 
                    And, soon after, her faith in her 
                    husband’s talent paid off.
                    In 1990, Wilson earned his
                    first commission, photographing 
                    BoDeans for Warner Brothers. 
                    He has since shot 300 album 
                    covers, worked on more than 
                    500 album packages and has four 
                    books published, all of which 
                    are currently out of print. In 
                    hindsight, Wilson admits the 
                    path he took appears inevitable 
                    now. ‘Music and portraits 
                    have been two of my strongest 
                    interests for a very long time. 
                    Much of my best energy has been 
                    directed to these two areas.’

                <p><span class="firstLetter">I</span>n 1992, Tim Stedman, 
                    a designer who was working 
                    for MCA Records at the 
                    time, introduced Lyle 
                    Lovett to Wilson’s work. 
                    Lyle had previously selected 
                    a photographer to shoot his 
                    upcoming album cover for 
                    Joshua Judges Ruth but agreed 
                    to do a shoot with him and the 
                    resulting images were used for 
                    the inside booklet of the record. 
                    Since then Wilson has shot all of 
                    the covers for Lyle’s albums. His 
                    latest, Release Me, was the tenth 
                    album cover they did together.
                    As a sustained ongoing 
                    relationship with a top artist 
                    like Lyle Lovett is unique, 
                    Wilson views it as a rare gift 
                    and modestly admits, ‘Though 
                    it sounds a cliché, I cannot find 
                    a better explanation for such 
                    working relationships other 
                    than respect and trust…the same things that sustain any 
                    friendship.’ Additionally, Wilson 
                    has enjoyed sustained working 
                    relationships with other artists, 
                    including Over the Rhine, Buddy 
                    Miller and Brad Mehldau.
                    Perhaps what strikes me as 
                    most remarkable is that Wilson 
                    continues to reinvent himself in 
                    his personal projects. One of his 
                    most absorbing series, People 
                    I Knew/Didn’t Know, is a rich 
                    collection of portraits that span 
                    a period of 30 years; the oldest 
                    representing some of his earliest 
                    encounters with photography. As 
                    making portraits has become his 
                    livelihood, this work is different 
                    in that none of the pictures 
                    were planned or scheduled 
                    and they were made free of 
                    commercial obligation or outside 
                    expectations. He says, ‘I continue 
                    to be grateful to everyone who has 
                    let me stand in front of them and 
                    make a picture…no small gift.’
                    Currently Wilson continues 
                    to shoot album covers and 
                    packaging, but is not doing as 
                    much as in the past. His most 
                    recent commissioned project 
                    was an eight LP box set for jazz 
                    pianist Brad Mehldau. He’s also 
                    working on a personal series that 
                    focuses on a couple of streets 
                    near his home in Cincinnati. 
                    He explains the images are 
                    not intended as documentary 
                    explorations and says he’s ‘just 
                    out collecting clues – fragments 
                    and found phrases that will 
                    hopefully make sense in some 
                    other, bigger collection further 
                    down the line.’
